# 🧪 SimBench

> A personal repository of power electronics simulations built using MATLAB and Simulink — ranging from converters and inverters to MPPT and grid-tied PV systems.

These simulations were developed during core electrical engineering coursework, each aimed at visualizing and understanding real-world energy systems.
